### Hi everyone
  
BlockChain enthusiast and software developer, Living in Recife - Pernambuco.
I have worked for companies such as Accenture and the Government of Pernambuco Secretariat for Women.
Like to get involved in events and communities, especially those that are focused on including people in technology, my hobbies are running and cycling.
I am a pragmatic, empathetic person, focused on results and of course always open to new ideas.
In addition to programming languages, I've always been interested in data and information. Because of this, I decided to study Database, which I will be graduating in March 2023.
