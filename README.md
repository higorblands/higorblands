### Hi everyone
  
BlockChain developer and enthusiast, I live in Recife - Pernambuco.
I have worked for companies such as Accenture and the Government of Pernambuco Secretariat for Women.
I like to get involved in events and communities, especially those that are focused on including people in technology, my hobbies are running and cycling.
I am a pragmatic, empathetic person, focused on results and of course always open to new ideas.
In addition to programming languages, I've always been interested in data and information. Because of this, I decided to study Database, which I will be graduating in March 2023.
