### Hi everyone

I'm a software developer with a solid experience of eight years in the IT area, residing in Recife, Pernambuco. Since my beginning, I have immersed myself in the world of technology, accumulating valuable experiences along my journey.

With a specialized background in databases, I am prepared to face the most complex challenges in this field, having consolidated my skills in SQL and NoSQL databases.

My trajectory includes significant collaborations with renowned companies. As a Software Developer, I had the opportunity to create innovative solutions in the ERP environment, in addition to contributing to the development of modern and scalable applications in cloud.

Outside the world of technology, I am passionate about running and cycling, activities that provide me with balance and inspiration in my professional journey.

With a few years of experience in IT and an approach that is always open to new challenges, I am excited to continue exploring the exciting opportunities that the Web3 era has to offer. Let's embark on this journey of innovation and growth together! ðŸš€
